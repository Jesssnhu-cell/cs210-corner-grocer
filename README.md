# Corner Grocer – Portfolio Reflection

## Project Summary
This C++ program analyzes a grocery store’s daily purchase log, counts item frequencies, prints results as a list and a histogram, and writes a backup file (frequency.dat). It helps the store decide how to lay out their produce section more effectively.

## What I Did Well
I structured the program clearly using functions and/or a class, kept consistent naming, and added comments to make the code readable.

## Opportunities for Enhancement
I could add stronger input validation and error handling for missing/corrupt files. These improvements would make the program more reliable and secure.

## Challenges & Solutions
File I/O and frequency counting were tricky at first. I solved this by using C++ `map` containers and testing with sample data. Documentation and practice helped me get past errors.

## Transferable Skills
I practiced OOP, file handling, and using STL containers—all of which are transferable to future coursework and real-world programming.

## Maintainability & Readability
I wrote small, focused functions, used meaningful variable names, and added inline comments. This makes the program easier to adapt if requirements change later.
